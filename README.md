A voxel game using the Godot Engine
This is a spin off from Metiistech, with rewritten player character and a voxel engine now based on Marching Cubes. This spinoff isn't supposed to mimic Minecraft, but to research the feasibility of a voxel engine in GDScript. Both this project and Metiistech won't have any update from now on and will only be kept for reference. The reason is that it was deemed impractical to accomplish the goals and maintain software performance in Godot 3.2. Maybe when Godot 4.0 comes out this will change
